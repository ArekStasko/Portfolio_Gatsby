text: I wanted to do this project as best I can, 
      I wanted it to be fast and to use a lot of animation, 
      I used Gatsby because it is an ideal technology for blogs, 
      it is fast and the using of photos is very convenient. Of course 
      I had a lot of problems but I solve them all. When i was creating 
      this project, I modeled the pages from awwwards, what's more, I made and 
      edited multimedia on the website using Photoshop, which may be an additional advantage.
