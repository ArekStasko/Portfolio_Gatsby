text: For me, this project was an attempt to go beyond the frontend, 
      I used the technologies that I learned for a short time, it allowed 
      me to understand how the authorization and validation system is created,  
      what I want to use in near time projects, during the project I encountered 
      many problems and I was forced to read the documentation many times, but thanks 
      to that I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. But of course I don't feel like 
      person with big knowledge in these technologies.
