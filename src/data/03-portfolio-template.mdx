text: I did this project as part of an easy-code course where 
      I was controlled by a mentor who thoroughly checked the 
      effects of my work and paid attention to every mistake. 
      It was a project that taught me how to reproduce the style 
      of a page from a project received by a graphic designer, 
      it was also my first time when i have a code review.
