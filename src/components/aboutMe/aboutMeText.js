      <h1>Hello,</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Arek Sta≈õko, I am 18 years old, I have been learning
        JavaScript language for two years, which has become from interest to
        daily routine, what's more the possibility of working with more
        experienced programmers is my dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing for me is the opportunity to gain experience
        and knowledge as well as the develop into my skills. I learned at a
        military high school, thanks to which I am disciplined and my superiors
        are my authority. I am going to study computer science in the near
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned JavaScript from foreign courses and by reading documentation
        (for example mdn) and by carrying out projects.
